react automatically updates the DOM(UI) when your data model changes

lets you iterate on the interface by combining, expanding, and moving around self-contained elements(components)

you pass new data to the components, and react takes care of tedious manipulations

react enforces strict rules to share data between components

map data to HTML elements

renderers components and props

express the UI as a function of the data
